# My-Weather-App

I found this to be challenging. I was not able to retrieve the different cities with a search function.
But after brainstorming I decided to create links to cities that are already listed. The cities will have
to be clicked in the order in which they appear to work.

I was happy that I was at least able to pull data from the API because earlier this week I wasn't able to do so.
I followed Bob's advice. If you can;t make it work, then do what you know how to do.
