# My-Weather-App

The purpose of this app is for the user to be able to access the current weather for different cities.

I used a weather API and I found this to be challenging. I was not able to retrieve the different cities with a search function and still researching to find out how to accomplish this task.

But after brainstorming I decided to create links to cities that are already listed. The cities will have
to be clicked in the order in which they appear to work.

I was happy that I was at least able to pull data from the API because earlier this week I wasn't able to do so.
This app is a work iin progress.
